# Mathematical modeling

## About
[Lab1](1/src/RandomVariableGenerating.Demo): 2-D random variable generator and it's statistic investigation.

Lab2: queueing system simulation and investigation. [theoretical](2/src/QueueingSystem.Demo) statistics and [empirical](2/src/des) statistics.

[Lab3](3/src/SystemCharacteristics): statistics effectiveness.

## Requirements
- .NET 5
- .NET Core 3.1 (on Linux to use [Random Variable Generating](1/src/RandomVariableGenerating) library without fails.)
- python 3.9+ with {sci,num,sim}py, matplotlib libraries installed (and Pillow on Linux).
