# Mathematical modeling

## About
[Lab1](1/src/RandomVariableGenerating.Demo): 2-d random variable generator and it's statistic investigation.

[Lab2](2/des.py): queueing system simulation and investigation.

[Lab3](2/lab3.py): effectiveness of queueing system with one server with 3 and 4 queue capacity

## Requirements
- .net 5
- .net core 3.1 (on linux, to use [random variable generating](1/src/RandomVariableGenerating) library without fails.)
- python 3.9+ with {sci,num,sim}py, matplotlib, prettytable libraries installed (and Pillow on Linux).
